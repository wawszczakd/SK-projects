# SK Projects

This repository contains my projects from the course "Computer Networks".

## Overview

SK stands for "Sieci Komputerowe" in Polish, which translates to "Computer
Networks". This repository includes my projects from this course. I completed
projects one and three, which fulfilled the requirements for the course.

## Project Descriptions

Below is the list of short project descriptions:

1. **Internet Radio Transmitter and Receiver**: This project involves creating
an internet radio transmitter and receiver. The transmitter sends a stream of
data received from the standard input to the receiver, which plays the audio on
the standard output. The communication between the transmitter and receiver is
done over UDP, following a specific audio data protocol.

3. **Router Configuration and Network Tracing**: This project focuses on
configuring routers, analyzing network communication, and performing traceroute
and dig commands. The task involves drawing logical connections between routers
and providing routing table fragments. Additionally, traceroute results from
specific computers to a target computer are examined. The zone file
"zad3sik.edu.pl" mapping names to IP addresses is also required.

Please refer to the respective project directories for detailed solutions.
